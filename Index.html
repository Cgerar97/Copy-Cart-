   <h1 style="font-size: 30px;"strong> Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1> </b>
    <br>
    Dear Eileen,
    </p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br>
    of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Starting dates</h2>

<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
     could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li></ul>
    
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a>  on our website.</p>
    
   <h2>Subjects of study</h2> 

<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall <br>
     somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
    by are as follows, in order of priority:

    <ol><li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C <sub>14</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O <sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience <br>
             size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>>3x10 <sup>4</sup>)</li> 
        <br>
        <li> <ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        <br></ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2> 


<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
     my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<br>
<b><p>Polynesian chicken dance</p> </b>
 
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>
    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</p></ul>

   <b> <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p></b>

   <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably <br>
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
    modem styles such as Twerking.</p></ul>
    
   <b><p>Arctic robot dance</p></b> 
    
   <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
    discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
    because they were really cold.</p></ul>
    
   <br>

<br>


Yours sincerely,
<br>
<br>
<br>
